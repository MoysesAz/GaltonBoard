        "An interesting application of the normal distribution is in the construction of Galton's board. This machine consists of a series of pins that form a vertical grid, and a sphere is added to the top which is released and falls through the pins, being deflected at each level. The spheres that fall on each level represent the observations of an experiment, and their distribution on the board reflects the normal distribution."

There are few very short and very tall people, while there is a huge amount of people with average height. This pattern is found in thousands of different subjects./nGalton believed that human traits, such as height and intelligence, were solely determined by genetics and that their distribution in the population followed a normal curve. However, modern science has shown that other factors, such as environment and experience, also play a significant role and that the distribution of traits in the population doesn't always follow a normal curve. Despite this, the Gaussian distribution remains a useful tool in statistics and data analysis."

Now, instead of the balls falling from the middle, they fall from the left, and where they land represents each individual's social position. Imagine that you have faced many difficulties, such as lack of economic resources and limited access to education and opportunities. The more disadvantaged you are, the further to the left you will fall. This can be even more pronounced in societies with large inequalities. Also observe the difficulty of upward mobility, as few people are able to transcend the top 20% of the population."

Although an individual's social position may be influenced by factors such as their income, education, and opportunities, social inequality is not a coincidence, but rather a consequence of social structures and policies that perpetuate inequality. Social equality is not an unattainable utopia, but rather an achievable goal through conscious efforts and well-planned public policies aimed at reducing economic and social disparities."
